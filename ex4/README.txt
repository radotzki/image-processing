The source of these rings is the rect function which after inverse Fourier transform converts to sinc(x) function.
In addition multiplication in the frequency domain is equivalent to a convolution in the image domain.
The sinc function is has an oscillatory impulse response thus creating the rings artifacts associated with the low pass filter.
